## Overview

Welcome and thank you for looking at my README! This assignment was a tough challange but _I_ tried my best and that's what matters. We were instructed to build a portfolio from scratch while using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to make it responsive. I've made 3 webpages, **About Me**, **Portfolio**, and **Contact Me**. Each page links to each other on the Navbar pulled from **Bootstrap**. I also used my own CSS file to customize certain elements such as font, color, background, etc.

## Installation

No installation is really needed for this. Just follow the link above to view the Portfolio.

## Contribution

No contribution is necessary, but any input and criticism would be _**GREATLY**_ appreciated.
